            <h1>The WSO2 APP Manager 1.6.0 Released!</h1>

            <p>
                The WSO2 APP Manager team is pleased to announce the release of version 1.6.0 of
                the Open Source APP Manager.
            </p>

            <p>
                WSO2 APP Manager is a platform for creating, managing, consuming and monitoring
                APIs. It employs proven SOA best practices to solve a wide range of API
                management challenges such as API provisioning, API governance, API security
                and API monitoring. It combines some of the most powerful and mature components
                of the WSO2's state-of-the-art Carbon platform to deliver a smooth and end-to-end
                API management experience while catering to both API publisher and API consumer
                requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                WSO2 APP Manager is comprised of several modules.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>API Provider:</b> Define new APIs and manage them</li>
                <li><b>API Store:</b> Browse published APIs and subscribe to them</li>
                <li><b>API Gateway:</b> The underlying API runtime based on WSO2 ESB</li>
                <li><b>API Key Manager:</b> Performs Key Generation and Key Validation functionalities</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                WSO2 APP Manager is developed on top of the revolutionary
                <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a>
                (Middleware a' la carte),
                an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
                componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of
                optional components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior
                of the APP Manager. Further, any existing features of the product which are not
                required in your environment can be easily removed using the underlying
                provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 APP Manager can be fully
                customized and tailored to meet your exact API management needs.
            </p>
